	   <h2>Scoring a Game:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Points:</strong> The point score in tennis goes in a sequence of 0 (also referred to as "Love"), 15, 30, and 40. If both players reach 40, it's called a "Deuce."</li>
        <li><strong>Winning a Point:</strong> A player wins a point by hitting the ball into the opponent's court in such a way that the opponent cannot return it.</li>
        <li><strong>Deuce:</strong> When the score reaches 40-40, it is called a "Deuce." To win from a Deuce, a player must score two consecutive points (the first point won takes the player to "Advantage").</li>
        <li><strong>Game:</strong> A player wins the game after reaching 40 and then winning the next point, unless the score reaches Deuce, in which case they must win by two clear points.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scoring a Set:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Winning a Game:</strong> Each game won contributes to the player's set score.</li>
        <li><strong>Winning a Set:</strong> A player wins a set by being the first to win 6 games, but they must win by at least two clear games. If the set reaches 6-6, it typically goes to a tiebreak, which is played first to 7 points, but similarly, must be won by at least two clear points.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scoring a Match:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Best of 3 or 5 Sets:</strong> Matches are typically best out of 3 (women's professional and mixed matches) or 5 sets (men's professional matches). The player (or doubles team) who wins the majority of the allocated sets wins the match.</li>
        <li><strong>Winning the Match:</strong> In a best of 3 sets match, the player that wins 2 sets first wins the match. In a best of 5 sets match, the first to win 3 sets wins the match.</li>
    </ul>
