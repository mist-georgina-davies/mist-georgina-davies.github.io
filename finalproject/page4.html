        <h2>1. The Forehand</h2>
        <p>The forehand is one of the primary strokes in tennis. To execute a proper forehand, stand sideways to the net, swing the racket back, and then forward, striking the ball with the racketâ€™s strings. Follow through with your swing, moving the racket across your body. Your weight should transfer from the back foot to the front foot during the swing.</p>

        <h2>2. The Backhand</h2>
        <p>The backhand stroke can be executed with either one hand or two hands on the racket. Similar to the forehand, start by positioning yourself sideways to the net. Swing the racket back and strike the ball with the racket's strings, following through across your body. The backhand often requires additional practice to master, due to its reliance on the non-dominant arm.</p>

        <h2>3. The Serve</h2>
        <p>The serve initiates the point in tennis. Start by standing behind the baseline, toss the ball into the air, and strike it as it falls, aiming into the diagonally opposite service box. A solid serve combines power and precision, and mastering it can give you a significant advantage in your game.</p>

        <h2>4. The Volley</h2>
        <p>A volley involves hitting the ball before it bounces on the ground. Typically executed near the net, volleys require swift reflexes and a shortened swing. The objective is to direct the ball where the opponent cannot reach it, often exploiting their position on the court.</p>
