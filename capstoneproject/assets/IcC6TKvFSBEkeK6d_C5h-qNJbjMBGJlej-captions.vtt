00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:06.170
Welcome to Bay View Academy's onboarding module
on restorative practices.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.550
In this segment, we will introduce you to
the basics of restorative practices, a vital

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.219
part of our school's culture.

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.800
So, what are restorative practices?

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.510
Well, imagine this: a student is playing with
a ball at recess, they kick it, and it breaks

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.000
a classroom window.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.180
In a traditional setting, the student might
be punished, perhaps even suspended.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.340
But does this approach truly solve the underlying
problem?

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.300
Enter restorative practices.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.660
Rather than focusing on punishment, restorative
practices emphasis understanding and healing.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.891
It's about bringing together those affected
by an action to discuss its impact, understand

00:00:53.891 --> 00:00:58.260
its root causes and collaboratively find a
way forward.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.260
The goal?

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.870
To repair relationships, rebuild trust and
foster a sense of community.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.830
At BVA, restorative practices are anchored
in three foundational principles.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.229
First, there's accountability, which emphasizes
owning up to our actions and understanding

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.370
their repercussions on others.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.049
Next, the approach is orientated around the
person harmed, ensuring the needs of those

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:32.420
who have been affected by any harm are addressed,
lastly the significance of community involvement

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.600
is championed.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.950
Promoting a collective responsiblity for resolving
conflicts.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.570
Our restorative practices are guided by values
like empathy, respect, fairness and inclusion.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.390
These values shape our interactions and responses.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.439
At BVA we embrace restorative practices in
the context of our diverse community.

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.350
It's about speaking your truth, listening
to others and fostering trust, safety and

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.130
belonging.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.229
So, in essence, traditional punitive practices
focus on punsihment for wrong doing whereas

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.200
restorative practices emphasizer understanding,
healing and rebuilding relationships after

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.870
harm has occurred.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.680
As we explore restorative practices further
it's important to remember that while they

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.480
have gained popularity and momentum in modern
times, especially in education, their roots

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.910
run deep indigenous communities.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.420
Join us in this first module to delve into
the rich indigenous history.
