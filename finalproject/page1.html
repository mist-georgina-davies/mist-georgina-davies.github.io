                <p> Stand behind the baseline, facing the net. If you're playing singles, stand closer to the middle of the court. For doubles, stand a bit to the side. Point your left foot toward the net post on the opposite side. Your right foot should be parallel to the court.</p>

            <div class="stepDescription">
                <p>Hold the tennis ball in your left hand and your racquet in your right hand. Place your left hand so that the ball is close to the throat of the racket. Hold the racket like you are shaking hands. Don't hold the racket too tight, keep your grip relaxeded, like a 4 out of 10, for a more powerful serve.</p>

        <summary class="stepTitle"> Step 3: Toss The Ball 
        </summary>

        <div class="stepContent">

            <div class="stepDescription">
                <p> Now it's time to toss the tennis ball into the air. Use your hand that's not holding the racket to gently throw the ball upwards. As you do this, drop your other arm and separate them both. Try to toss the ball just above your hitting hand's highest point. This helps you hit the ball in the right place for a good serve. Remember, don't toss the ball too high or too low. And make sure to shift your weight slightly forward as you toss. If you shift it backward, you might toss the ball behind you. It's like a little dance move that helps you serve better!</p>
                <p>Many people struggle with the ball toss and placement. Here are 5 additional tips to improve your tennis ball toss:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Practice tossing the ball to the same spot every time to establish a reliable starting point.</li>
                    <li>Toss the ball just above your hitting hand's highest point for comfortable and effective contact.</li>
                    <li>Use your non-dominant hand to guide the toss, ensuring control and accuracy.</li>
                    <li>Toss the ball smoothly and parallel to the net, avoiding jerky movements.</li>
                    <li>Shift your weight slightly forward as you toss to set up a balanced stance for your serve.</li>
                </ol>

        <summary class="stepTitle"> Step 4: Racket Back, Ball Up
        </summary>

        <div class="stepContent">

            <div class="stepDescription">
                <p> Bring the racket head above you and bend your elbow, like you're scratching your back with the racket's side. Don't forget to bend your knees too, as this helps your racket go up. This move gives the ball more power. With practice, this will become one smooth motion â€” tossing the ball up with one hand while using the racket to scratch your back with the other. You can practice this move as much as you want before actually hitting the ball (just not during a game, or you might test your opponent's patience). Some beginners lift the racket behind their back before tossing the ball. This might make it easier to hit the ball, but you'll have less power and momentum. As you let go of the ball you're tossing, put most of your weight on your back leg, loading your back knee. This way, when you make contact, you can spring forward using your back leg's energy.</p>

      <summary class="stepTitle"> Step 5: Hit The Ball </summary>
      <div class="stepContent">
        <div class="stepDescription">
          <p> When the ball is at the right height, use the side of your racket to hit it. Aim to hit the ball in the center of the racket's strings. Your goal is to hit the ball with a smooth and controlled motion. As you hit the ball, shift your weight from your back foot to your front foot and follow through with your swing. This will help you send the ball over the net and into the opponent's side of the court.</p>
          <p>Remember, practicing these steps and staying patient will help you improve your serve over time. It's all about getting the rhythm and technique right. With practice, your serves will become more accurate and powerful!</p>
